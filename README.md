## ‚úçÔ∏è Content Management

This project uses a simple, manual content management system by editing the `videos.js` file directly on GitHub. This gives you full control over your library.

#### How to Add a New Movie or Series:

1.  **Go to the `js/videos.js` file** in your GitHub repository:
    [https://github.com/TMRatul49/MovieSaviour_Website/blob/main/js/videos.js](https://github.com/TMRatul49/MovieSaviour_Website/blob/main/js/videos.js)

2.  **Click the "Edit" icon** (a small pencil) in the top-right corner of the file view.

3.  To add a new entry, copy an existing object (from `{` to `}`) and paste it at the end of the list, ensuring there is a comma `,` after the preceding object.

4.  **Update the details** for your new entry:
    * `id`: A unique, all-lowercase name (e.g., `"the-dark-knight"`).
    * `type`: `"movie"`, `"drama"`, or `"anime"`.
    * `subcategory`: The specific category (e.g., `"Hollywood"`).
    * `imdb_id`: The correct ID from the IMDb website (e.g., `"tt0468569"`).
    * `google_drive_id` (for movies) or `seasons`/`episodes` (for series) with your Google Drive links.

5.  **Scroll down and save** by clicking the "Commit changes" button. Netlify will automatically see the update and deploy your new content to the live site within minutes.
